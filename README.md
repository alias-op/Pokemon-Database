# Pokemon-Database
The ultimate database for Pokémon fans
# 1. Background
First things first, this list was inspired by BronzeMaster5000, who posted a Living Dex spreadsheet on Reddit a couple of years ago. I had been searching for a way to keep track of my collection and came across his spreadsheet.

After downloading it, I quickly realized that it wasn’t quite what I was looking for. While it was great, it didn’t fully meet my needs. There were too many worksheets, the information was too scattered, and I was convinced there had to be a way to consolidate everything into just one worksheet. I wanted a list that unified all the information in one place and allowed me to filter out details that would otherwise require extensive internet research. As good as websites like PokéWiki or Serebii are, nothing beats an Excel list that lets you find what you’re looking for in seconds. At the same time, the list should serve as a tool to track your personal collection. I also aimed to make it customizable and expandable for everyone, ensuring that embedded formulas or links wouldn’t break during updates.

This spreadsheet is both a database and a tracker for your Pokémon collection, all in one worksheet.

After many, many hours of work, I’ve finally brought my idea to life. I didn’t want to keep the result to myself because I believe many Pokémon fans like me—especially those who enjoy the collecting aspect of Pokémon—will appreciate such a list. I am not publishing this list as competition to the excellent work of BronzeMaster5000. Rather, I want to offer an alternative that, from my perspective, is easier to use and provides more possibilities for utilizing the data for various evaluations. For example, one of the many applications is graphically preparing the distribution of all Pokémon types in no time at all. Below, I will briefly explain the structure of the list, its filtering options, and the updates I plan for the future.

I hope this list will improve with your feedback, and I look forward to your suggestions and comments.

# 2. What’s the logic behind my spreadsheet?  
Currently, the spreadsheet provides an overview of all boxable and Home-compatible Pokémon. Essentially, it is a Living Form Dex. By official count, there are currently 1,025 Pokémon. When including all other forms (gender variations, alternate forms, regional forms), there are exactly 1,390 Pokémon that can be stored in Pokémon Home. While there are many more forms, such as Mega Evolutions, these are not yet listed separately. However, you can easily filter Pokémon with Mega Evolutions. Similarly, while there are other boxable Pokémon in the mainline games (such as Spiky-Eared Pichu), I decided to focus on Home-compatible Pokémon first.

The list consists of six sections:  
- **Pokédex (columns A to M):** Essentially your personalized Pokédex with various filter options, such as displaying only non-evolving Pokémon or filtering by region. German names link directly to PokéWiki.  
- **Storage (columns N to T):** Keep track of your collection, including the Pokémon’s region of origin, the type of Poké Ball it’s in, and whether you caught it as a Shiny.  
- **Collectables (columns U to AE):** Over the course of nine mainline games, Pokémon introduced numerous collectible categories, such as N’s Pokémon in Gen V or Alpha Pokémon in Legends: Arceus. This section lets you track which collectibles you’ve caught.  
- **Database (columns AF to AR):** A comprehensive overview that allows you to display various Pokémon categories using filters.  
- **Regional Pokédex (columns AS to BP):** Your Regional Dexes organized by Dex Number.  
- **Availability (columns BQ to CA):** This section took considerable research. It details which Pokémon are available in each game, including transfer-only (Dexit) and event-only Pokémon.

Last but not least, the **Overview worksheet** automatically tracks your collection.

# 3. How do I organize my HOME boxes?  
The entire list is based on Serebii’s *List of Depositable Pokémon*. I’ve structured my Pokémon Home collection following this order for my Living Form Dex.

# 4. Future Plans  
I plan to add more columns to the spreadsheet in the future. As you can see, I haven’t completed all Regional Dexes yet, and some games are missing availability data. I also hope to include unboxable forms eventually. That said, I’m quite satisfied with the current version of the spreadsheet, as it works seamlessly even without the yet-to-be-added content.
